# Blog-API
Project: Blog API - The Odin Project

# Summary
Created a backend API for a blog. The API can be applied to a front-end to allow users to read posts, sign up and log in, in order to 
create posts and comment on them. A user can delete and edit their own posts and comments. Used various validation functions to verify
each step with error messages. Used tokens to authorize REST actions.
